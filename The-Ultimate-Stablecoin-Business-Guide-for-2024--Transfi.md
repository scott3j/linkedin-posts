## Introduction

Stablecoins now make up about 10% of the entire digital currency market by market cap. Despite the 2022 digital currency crash that briefly shrunk the stablecoin market, today's market capitalization and trading volumes have nearly rebounded to their previous peaks. Global giants like SAP, PayPal, and Visa are embracing these digital assets as a new method for payment and settlement.

In this guide, we’ll break down the essentials: what stablecoins are, the various types available, the advantages they offer, and how businesses can integrate them seamlessly and securely.

## What are Stablecoins?

Stablecoins are a type of digital currency specifically designed to reduce price volatility. They achieve this stability by pegging their value to a more stable asset, often a specific fiat currency in a one-to-one ratio, or a tangible commodity like gold. To maintain a steady price, stablecoin operators either hold physical reserves of the underlying asset or use sophisticated algorithms to balance supply and demand fluctuations. These operators are usually private organizations or foundations; for instance, Tether is managed by Tether Limited, while USD Coin is issued by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle. Currently, the most popular stablecoins are those pegged to fiat currencies, such as Tether, but there are also crypto-backed stablecoins that use cryptocurrencies as collateral to maintain stability.

## How Do Stablecoins Work?

Stablecoins function much like other digital currencies, operating on blockchains that are active 24/7, allowing for near-instant trading and exchange. These are designed to be compatible with multiple blockchains, enhancing their versatility. By combining the advantages of digital currencies with the price stability of traditional financial instruments, they have become a popular choice for settling payments. This is particularly advantageous for cross-border transactions, where traditional banking systems can be fragmented, making payments slow, complicated, and expensive. Stablecoins serve as a medium of exchange, providing a stable value that allows for routine transactions without the risk of sudden price changes for holders. They also offer additional utility possibilities such as lending and borrowing, making them a versatile tool for businesses and individuals alike, especially for those looking to invest in real assets. Additionally, stablecoins have gained attention as potential alternatives to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), although they are not the same thing. While both are forms of digital money, CBDCs are issued and regulated by central banks, while stablecoins are typically issued by private entities.

Similar to other digital currencies, stablecoins are transferred on blockchains using public addresses (or public keys), which are akin to bank account numbers. The balance associated with each address is maintained in a digital wallet.

## Exploring the Various types of Stablecoins

Stablecoins come in four distinct types: fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, algorithmic, and commodity-collateralized. Let’s dive into each category to understand their unique characteristics:

### Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins

Fiat-collateralized or off-chain stablecoins, are anchored by reserves of traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, stored in a bank account or custody service. The supply of these stablecoins matches the fiat currency reserves held. Prominent examples include [Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC)](https://www.transfi.com/blog/usdc-vs-usdt) .

### Commodity-Collateralized Stablecoins

Commodity-collateralized stablecoins are tied to reserves of physical assets like gold, silver, or other commodities. Each stablecoin in circulation is backed by a corresponding quantity of the commodity, ensuring the stablecoin’s value reflects that of the underlying asset. Examples include PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (xAUT).

### Cryptocurrency-Collateralized Stablecoins

Cryptocurrency-collateralized or on-chain stablecoins are secured by reserves of other cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC). These assets utilize smart contracts to lock in cryptocurrency reserves. Notable examples include Dai (DAI) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

### Algorithmic Stablecoins

Algorithmic stablecoins, also referred to as non-collateralized or seigniorage-style stablecoins, rely on algorithms and smart contracts to regulate their supply and maintain their value. When the stablecoin’s price rises above its peg, the algorithm increases supply to bring the price down, and reduces supply when the price falls below the peg. This method of maintaining a stablecoin's value through manipulation of its circulating supply is known as "circulating supply management" and has come under scrutiny by regulators. An example of this type is USDD.

## The Best Stablecoins for Cross Border Payments

In our comprehensive article, 2024’s Elite Stablecoins: Your Cross-Border [Payment Solution](https://www.transfi.com/blog/best-stablecoin) we delve into the top stablecoins that businesses should prioritize.

We selected these based on their market size, representing 98% of the total market cap, as those with maturity, deep liquidity, and scale are more resilient to market shocks and evolving regulations.

We recommend Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) for cross-border businesses. Both are 'fiat-collateralized' and consistently hold their value at parity with the US dollar. Issued by established institutions, they provide regular attestation reports and operate across multiple blockchains, reducing operational risk and transaction fees. In our detailed article, Dollars in Digital: A Deep Dive into USDC and USDT for Businesses, we explore their key features, differences, and histories to understand their reliability, including their use of cash equivalents such as US Treasuries.

For alternatives, there are nearly 100 other options. Notable ones include Binance USD ([BUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/)), TrueUSD ([TUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/)), Pax Dollar ([USDP](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdp/)), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD), all sharing the fiat-collateralized mechanism. We also feature two gold-backed options: Pax Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), known for their stable value.

## How to Buy, Sell, and Store Stablecoins

The primary business use for stablecoins is to facilitate payments and settlements. However, let's first explore another valuable use case: balance sheet diversification.

Businesses often need to adjust financial strategies to protect against currency fluctuations and the adverse effects of inflation on cash reserves. These digital currencies offer an alternative market with stable prices, deep liquidity, and efficient trading mechanisms.

For long-term value storage, purchasing is straightforward via digital exchanges or third parties. Once acquired, they can be stored on an exchange (with counterparty risk) or transferred to a private wallet, managed internally or through a service provider.

## Streamlining Business Payments and Settlements with Stablecoins

For many businesses, stablecoins offer a seamless alternative to the inefficiencies of traditional payment and settlement methods. Much like conventional payment systems, most businesses rely on third-party providers to facilitate stablecoin transactions. These partners offer the necessary infrastructure and regulatory compliance, secure competitive rates through access to liquidity markets, manage the conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoins, and provide lending services, mitigating exposure risks.

[TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/) is one such fintech platform that enables businesses to integrate stablecoins into their fiat payment and settlement processes without ever directly handling the stablecoins if they prefer. Here’s how TransFi processes a stablecoin-enabled cross-border payment, a method that can also be used for settling fiat funds between foreign entities within the same organization.

1.  **_Account Setup:_** The business opens an account with TransFi, which includes multiple wallets for different fiat currencies and stablecoins.
2.  **_Payment Initiation:_** Through the platform, the business initiates a payment to a supplier, choosing to fund the payment with either fiat or stablecoin deposits.
3.  **_Conversion and Transfer:_** If using fiat funds, TransFi leverages its liquidity partners to secure a competitive price for a stablecoin, typically Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), and executes the trade. TransFi holds the stablecoin and pays the supplier in their preferred fiat currency. Alternatively, TransFi can deposit the stablecoins in the payer’s wallet, moving to the next step.
4.  **_Stablecoin Transfer:_** If the payer is using existing stablecoin funds, TransFi transfers the stablecoin across the most suitable blockchain directly to the recipient’s digital wallet.

By utilizing [TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/), businesses can efficiently manage their [payment](https://www.transfi.com/products/payouts) and [settlement](https://www.transfi.com/products/collections) processes, leveraging stablecoins for speed, cost savings, and reliability.

## The Key Benefits of Stablecoins for Business

### Enhanced Cash Flow

Cash flow is a major challenge for businesses, often hampered by slow settlements, especially across multiple territories. Cross-border payments usually take complex routes, passing through several intermediary banks before clearing, with foreign exchange adding further delays. Stablecoins, free from these blockages and operating 24/7, offer fast settlements. The relative cost and speed of stablecoin settlements ensure that working capital is available when needed, facilitating smoother financial planning.

### Market Accessibility

Stablecoins provide an alternative payment and settlement solution for businesses in regions with limited banking infrastructure. This not only benefits businesses entering new markets but also recipient businesses that gain access to a broader range of goods and services.

### Cost Efficiency

Leading stablecoins operate on decentralized blockchains, allowing businesses to bypass the fees and costs associated with traditional intermediaries, currency conversions, and compliance requirements. A study showed that remittance costs in the foreign exchange market could be slashed by as much as 80%. Even when using stablecoins to bridge fiat currency trades (a process known as 'on- and off-ramping') with a third party, significant savings can be achieved. For example, moving funds from Southeast Asia to Europe can be 3-4 times cheaper using stablecoins compared to the Swift network, while transfers from Africa to Europe can be up to 5-10 times cheaper. Businesses with high volumes and lower risk profiles typically access better rates from providers, mirroring traditional payment systems.

### Balance Sheet Diversification

Stablecoins play a crucial role in optimizing a business's asset portfolio by offering an alternative to fiat currencies affected by high inflation or volatility. In countries with restricted access to the US dollar and other major currencies, stablecoins provide a reliable store of value.

### Automation and Smart Contracts

Stablecoins often utilize smart contracts, which can automate payment terms and conditions. By streamlining payment and settlement processes through smart contracts, businesses can reduce operating costs while benefiting from faster and more accurate transactions.

## Understanding the Risks of Stablecoins

### Counterparty Risk

Most leading stablecoins are issued and managed by a central entity, introducing counterparty risk similar to traditional banks and financial institutions. This includes risks of mismanagement, operational vulnerabilities, and cyber attacks. For fiat-collateralized stablecoins, the primary concern is the mismanagement of the reserves backing the stablecoin.

Businesses should seek stablecoin issuers that publish independent audits of their reserves, such as the transparency pages for Tether and USD Coin. Mitigating counterparty risk can be achieved by processing stablecoin payments and settlements through a reliable, regulated third party, which can assume the stablecoin exposure and handle operational and regulatory burdens.

### Depegging Concerns

In recent years, some stablecoins have temporarily lost their peg. In March 2023, USD Coin ([USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/)) dropped to 87 cents due to $3.3 billion of reserves held at the failed Silicon Valley Bank ([SVB](https://www.svb.com/)). Tether ([USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/)), the largest stablecoin by circulation, briefly lost parity with the dollar in May 2022, falling as low as $0.9959. While these fluctuations may seem minor, they can significantly impact businesses using stablecoins for payments or as assets. However, in each case, stability was quickly restored, with the peg reinstated within days, showcasing the resilience and potential of crypto-collateralized stablecoins like Ethereum-based Dai ([DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/)) and Paxos Standard ([PAX](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/paxos-standard/)). Another popular stablecoin, USD Coin, is managed by a consortium formed by Circle and Coinbase, two well-known companies in the cryptocurrency industry. As of late June 2024, stablecoins have continued to face depegging concerns, but their resilience and potential for stability have not wavered.

By leveraging stablecoins, businesses can achieve cost savings, improve cash flow, access new markets, and automate transactions while being mindful of the associated risks.

## How to Start Using Stablecoins for Cross Border Payments

Much like traditional and modern payment methods, the quickest and safest way for businesses to enable stablecoin payments and settlements is to outsource. Fintech platforms like [TransFi](https://www.transfi.com/) simplify the process for their clients while mitigating risks.

By partnering with a fintech like TransFi, businesses can quickly register and create an account with a stablecoin wallet, enabling them to initiate and settle payments immediately. These platforms often offer multiple accounts, allowing businesses to manage various stablecoin funds alongside fiat deposits from a single interface. This streamlined approach makes it easier and more cost-effective to trade currencies and transfer funds between entities.

Working with a trusted third party also minimizes risk. Businesses can use stablecoins as an intermediary to bridge trades and settlements between fiat currencies, offloading exposure to the fintech partner. This approach ensures that the stablecoin never directly impacts the business's balance sheet, mitigating the risk of depegging, mismanagement by the issuer, or unfavorable regulatory actions.

## The Future of Stablecoins: What's Next?

Stablecoins have cleared the first major hurdle of any new payment method: reaching critical mass. They currently make up about 10% of the digital currency market by market cap. With market capitalization and trading volumes nearly back to their 2022 peaks, about 75% of digital asset owners now hold these digital currencies. Daily transactions reach billions of dollars, and in 2022, settlements hit around $8 trillion—surpassing major card networks like Mastercard and American Express. By the end of 2023, on-chain volumes are expected to exceed those of Visa, the world's largest card network.

Globally, regulations are evolving to support merchants in adopting these digital currencies. In the U.S., a draft bill proposes that the Federal Reserve approve any non-bank issuers, including those abroad offering these assets on US exchanges. The approval criteria include maintaining and proving reserves, demonstrating technical expertise, established governance, and promoting financial inclusion and innovation. In the EU, the new MiCA framework (Markets in Crypto-Assets) introduces obligations around transparency and consumer protection. In the UK, the new Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB) places similar regulatory oversight.

## FAQ's

### What is a stablecoin and how does it differ from other cryptocurrencies?

Stablecoins offer stability in the volatile crypto market as they are pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies or commodities. They provide a safe haven for traders, reduce transaction costs, enable faster transactions, and offer protection against inflation and market fluctuations.

### What are some popular examples of stablecoins and how do they operate?

Popular stablecoins include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). They operate by pegging their value to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, to minimize price volatility. This ensures that stablecoin prices remain relatively stable compared to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

# Benefits of Using Stablecoins for Cross-Border Payments

## Fiat currencies vs Stablecoins

‍

Traditional fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar or Euro, are government-backed and have long been the primary mediums of exchange in the global economy. However, fiat currencies can be susceptible to inflation, slow transaction speeds, and high fees, especially in cross-border payments.

Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to minimize price volatility by being pegged to stable assets, like the US dollar or even gold. They offer the added benefits of blockchain technology - including faster transfer speeds, lower transaction fees, and 24/7 accessibility, making them an attractive alternative for settling global payments.

Among stablecoins, USDT holds a dominant market position with approximately 70% of market share, followed by USDC at 21% (CoinGecko). While stablecoins mitigate the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they too face challenges, such as potential regulatory changes and depegging.

Stablecoins are transforming global payments by addressing some of the inefficiencies associated with traditional banking. Here are key benefits stablecoins offer for cross-border transactions:

‍

- **Low fees**: Traditional cross-border payments often involve higher costs, especially cross-borders. Stablecoins enable direct transactions on the blockchain and can reduce these costs for businesses. It is estimated that on-chain FX could reduce remittance costs as much as 80% in some cases (Uniswap and Circle).

- **Speed**: Traditional international transfers can take several days to clear, while stablecoin transactions are processed almost instantly, irrespective of geographical boundaries, improving speed and efficiency.

- **Transparency**: The blockchain technology provides a transparent and unchangeable public ledger that is visible to all participants, fostering transparency and trust. Additionally, cryptographic algorithms in blockchain ensure data security. These foundations reduce potential fraud and errors in payment processes.
  Stability: Stablecoins are pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies, mitigating the volatility associated with traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and providing a reliable medium for international transactions.

- **Accessibility**: Unlike conventional banks, stablecoins are accessible 24 hours a day, all year round, allowing for financial transactions to be processed on weekends and holidays, thus enhancing accessibility for global business operations.

- **Global reach**: Stablecoins provide an effective means of payment option in regions with limited banking infrastructure. For instance, studies estimate that by using stablecoins, global businesses can reduce costs up to 10 times when making transactions to and from certain regions, like Africa or Southeast Asia.
